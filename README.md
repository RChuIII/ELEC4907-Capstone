# ELEC4907-Capstone
## Abstract
This project aims to develop a neural network model to predict the frequency response of high-frequency electronic circuits, specifically within the 1 to 20 GHz range. The approach involves training a single, comprehensive Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) capable of both classifying different circuit types and predicting their frequency responses. By leveraging simulations for training and only requiring a circuit image for the input, the model will streamline the circuit design process, providing quick and precise predictions without the need for extensive traditional simulations. Implemented using Python and the PyTorch library, the project offers significant potential to enhance the efficiency of high-frequency circuit design, reducing development time and resource requirements, and contributing valuable insights into the behavior of complex electronic systems.
